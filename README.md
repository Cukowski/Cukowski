## 👋 Welcome, curious wanderer!

I'm **Selçuk Ata**, a software engineer by trade, an existential tinkerer by night.  
Currently navigating the realms of **C++**, **Python**, and **game development** with **Godot**.  
My passion lies in crafting clever systems, solving weird problems, and building things that (hopefully) make people think.
